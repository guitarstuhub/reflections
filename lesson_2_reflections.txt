Creating a branch

For the asteroids project, we wanted the asteroid to break into 2 instead of 3 pieces, to make the game easier.

git branch (shows master)
git branch easy-mode (creates an easy-mode branch)
git checkout easy-mode switches to this branch
git branch shows the two brances with a * next to the current one

git branch new-branch
git checkout new_branch can be combined into one statement

git checkout -b new_branch

git auto merging and manual merging
A manual merge has to be done if there are conflicts, i.e. if more than one branch has made changes to one of the files.
You have to edit it to sort out the merge.
